# Elyon-Skill-Builder

Once you've download and saved it anywhere (preferably desktop), inside the folder, dbl click on `esbuilder.exe` and enjoy. If you like this, please consider giving the at [original dev](https://elyoncodex.com) some love. This was just made originally for me so I don't have to go to the browser while I'm in game and more accessible.

Check back for more updates as I have not build an auto-updater as of yet. Any changes to the Chrome/Edge version is set to auto-update as the original [original dev](https://elyoncodex.com) sets it upon deployment. You can also support him [here](https://www.patreon.com/mmomaster)
